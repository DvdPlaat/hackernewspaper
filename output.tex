\paragraph{Researchers seem to have solved the puzzle of LK-99. Scientific detective work has unearthed evidence that the material is not a superconductor, and clarified its actual properties.}

The conclusion dashes hopes that LK-99 — a compound of copper, lead, phosphorus and oxygen — would prove to be the first superconductor that works at room temperature and ambient pressure. Instead, studies have shown that impurities in the material — in particular, copper sulfide — were responsible for sharp drops in its electrical resistivity and a display of partial levitation over a magnet, properties similar to those exhibited by superconductors.
“I think things are pretty decisively settled at this point,” says Inna Vishik, a condensed-matter experimentalist at the University of California, Davis.
Claimed superconductor LK-99 is an online sensation — but replication efforts fall short
Claimed superconductor LK-99 is an online sensation — but replication efforts fall short
The LK-99 saga began in late July, when a team led by Sukbae Lee and Ji-Hoon Kim at the Quantum Energy Research Centre, a start-up firm in Seoul, published preprints1,2 claiming that LK-99 is a superconductor at normal pressure, and at temperatures up to at least 127 ºC (400 kelvin). All previously confirmed superconductors function only at very low temperatures and extreme pressures.
The extraordinary claim quickly grabbed the attention of the science-interested public and researchers, some of whom tried to replicate LK-99.

- We built a Twitter-scale Mastodon instance from scratch in only 10k lines of code.}
 This is 100x less code than the \~1M lines Twitter wrote to build and scale their original consumer product, which is very similar to Mastodon. Our instance is located at https://mastodon.redplanetlabs.com and open for anyone to use. The instance has 100M bots posting 3,500 times per second at 403 average fanout to demonstrate its scale.
- Our implementation is built on top of a new platform called Rama that we at Red Planet Labs have developed over the past 10 years. This is the first time we’re talking about Rama publicly. Rama unifies computation and storage into a coherent model capable of building end-to-end backends at any scale in 100x less code than otherwise. Rama integrates and generalizes data ingestion, processing, indexing, and querying. Rama is a generic platform for building application backends, not just for social networks, and is programmed with a pure Java API. I will be exploring Rama in this post through the example of our Mastodon implementation.
- We spent nine person-months building our scalable Mastodon instance. Twitter spent \~200 person-years to build and scale their original consumer product, and Instagram spent \~25 person-years building Threads, a recently launched Twitter competitor. In their effort Instagram was able to leverage infrastructure already powering similar products.

\paragraph{Ask vs guess culture
When unreasonable requests are followed up with "but you could have just said no!" Exploring the clashes of ask culture and guess culture, at home and at work.}

Have you had someone ask you for a favor that seemed unreasonable — a referral you didn’t want to make, a long-term stay at your place, a sizable cash loan? But because they asked, you felt obliged to seriously consider it, to try to meet their request, even if it put you in a space of discomfort? Maybe you carry out the favor, but it sours your relationship, and when it all comes out, that person says, “Well why’d you agree to it? You could have just said no!”
But you feel resentful that that person even put you in a position to have to say, “Sorry we’re a bit busy that week so don’t have space for you to stay with us,” or “I can’t loan you that money at the moment”?
Congratulations, you’ve just encountered a clash between ask culture and guess culture.
The idea of ask vs guess culture was shared online in 2007 by a user tangerine on Metafilter. When I first read it years ago, a lightbulb moment went off, and many frustrations and conflicts I had while growing up made much more sense in this framework.
Despite this idea’s longevity, I find that it’s still a new-to-many and incredibly useful concept to revisit, so here’s a little exploration of ask vs guess culture at home and at work.
Ask culture and guess culture are vastly different in behavior and expectations. Here are some highlights:

Write about what you learn. It pushes you to understand topics better.}
 Sometimes the gaps in our knowledge only become clear when explaining things to others.
Writing about what you learn is more than just a method of documentation; it's a powerful tool for deepening understanding and revealing the gaps in one's knowledge. This practice pushes us to explore topics more thoroughly and to articulate their thoughts in a coherent and precise manner.
Learning Through Writing
- Exploration: Writing about a subject can in cases require a comprehensive exploration of the topic. This often leads to uncovering new insights and connections that might not be apparent through mere reading or listening.
- Articulation: Putting thoughts into words forces a person to clarify their understanding. This process of articulation helps in identifying areas where the understanding might be vague or incomplete.
- Reflection: Writing allows for reflection on the subject matter, enabling the learner to connect new information with existing knowledge. This synthesis helps in creating a more robust and interconnected understanding of the subject.
- Revelation of Gaps: Sometimes, the act of writing reveals areas where the knowledge is lacking or inconsistent. Recognizing these gaps is the first step towards filling them and achieving a more complete understanding.
The Benefits

\paragraph{About a year ago, I raised a red flag with colleagues and managers about Postgres performance. Our database was struggling to keep up with the load generated by our monolithic SaaS application.}
 CPU utilization was riding between 60 and 80, and at least once it spiked to 100, causing a brief outage.
Now, we had been kicking the can down the road with respect to Postgres capacity for a long time. When the database looked too busy, we’d replace it with a bigger instance and move on. This saved us a lot of time and allowed us to focus on other things, like building features, which was great.
But this time, it wasn’t possible to scale the DB server vertically: we were already on the biggest instance. And we were about to overload that instance.
Lots of schemes were floated. Foremost among them:
- Shard writes. Spin up a cluster of independent databases, and write data to one or the other according to some partitioning strategy.
- Do micro-services. Split up the monolith into multiple interconnected services, each with its own data store that could be scaled on its own terms.
Both of these options are cool! A strong case can be made for either one on its merits. With write sharding, we could potentially increase our capacity by 2 or even 3 orders of magnitude. With micro-services, we’d be free to use “the right tool for the job,” picking data stores optimized to the requirements of each service workload. Either branch of the skill tree would offer exciting options for fault toler

\paragraph{How a startup loses its spark
At a well-run seed stage startup, engineers will often describe the work experience as intoxicating. At a larger company, the best you get is "enjoyable".}
 Why does this happen? Is it inevitable?
Let's inspect what makes a startup intoxicating. An engineer should spend most of their time in this core loop:
- If needed, talk to users, figure out their problems.
- Come up with an idea to build.
- If needed, discuss the idea with coworkers.
- Implement the idea.
- Cross fingers and ship. Celebrate or postmortem. Then go back to step 1.
At <10 people, each of these steps can be fun.
- You can just directly reach out to users you’re interested in and grab a beer with them.
- If you find an idea that you think is both valuable to the company and interesting to you, you can just drop everything to work on it.
- Almost any coworker will be interested in discussing this idea with you because:
- They have skin in the game. If your idea is good, they benefit from encouraging you to take it on. If your idea is bad, they benefit from explaining what’s wrong. They may even care as users themselves.
- They might want to work with you on it.
- They can likely offer useful insights since everyone’s familiar with a significant chunk of the codebase.
- Implementation is quick.
- Choose whatever tools you want, no security review.
- Small codebase. Can hold the whole thing in your head, so you feel comfortable making sweeping refactors. Fast hot reload, so can do qui

\paragraph{Carrot Problems
In World War II, the story goes, the British invented a new kind of onboard radar that allowed its pilots to shoot down German planes at night.}
[1]
They didn't want the Germans to know about this technology, but they had to give an explanation for their new, improbable powers.
So they invented a propaganda campaign that claimed their pilots had developed exceptional eyesight by eating "an excess of carrots."
If you're going to trick people into doing something pointless, eating excessive carrots seems like one of the better ones. Still, there's an issue: people who believed the propaganda and tried to get super-sight would be spending time and effort on something that wasn't going to work.[2]
I'll call this a Carrot Problem.
Once you look for Carrot Problems, you see them everywhere. Essentially, any time someone achieves success in a way they don't want to admit publicly, they have to come up with an excuse for their abilities. And that means misleading a bunch of people into (potentially) wasting their time, or worse.
For example:
- People who take steroids don't generally admit to taking steroids, so they come up with various explanations for their new physiques. But anyone who follows that advice will be disappointed; without the steroids, they just won't get the same results.
- Many companies basically distribute their jobs to friends and insiders, but don't want to admit that publicly. So they set up public application processes, which cause outsiders to

And one day after months of use it froze mid-game and went into a BIOS loop and wouldn't boot. I quickly realized that only one of the Seagate Firecuda 530 SSDs was detected. After some unscrewing and experimenting with the two drives in the two slots I found that one of them was dead.
And then I left the PC alone for a few days and turned it on again. It booted into Windows and immediately crashed.
That made me wonder if the failure was temperature related; when cool it seemed to work. So, I left the Firecuda in the freezer at -18C for 30 minutes. Inserting it into an NVMe M.2 USB case I was able to see the drive on my Mac. Success!
Well, for a few minutes. It seemed that as the drive heated up it failed again. Which lead me to believe that there was a faulty connection somewhere on the board. Very careful plugging and unplugging of the board helped me find the right spot to squeeze one of the chips to make the SSD work: no low temperatures needed.
Now, I couldn't possibly sit and hold the SSD squeezing the chip while I copied off the data so I came up with another solution. A metal G clamp and strips of a Silicon Valley Bank credit card under the SSD to support the PCB.

Story Highlights
- Routinely greeting six neighbors maximizes wellbeing outcomes
- All five wellbeing elements linked to greeting neighbors
- Greeting neighbors climbs steadily with age, peaking among 65 and older
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Adults in the U.S. who regularly say hello to multiple people in their neighborhood have higher wellbeing than those who greet fewer or no neighbors. Americans’ wellbeing score increases steadily by the number of neighbors greeted, from 51.5 among those saying hello to zero neighbors to 64.1 for those greeting six neighbors. No meaningful increase in wellbeing is seen for additional neighbors greeted beyond six.
These results were collected as part of the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index. The index is calculated on a scale of zero to 100, where zero represents the lowest possible wellbeing and 100 represents the highest possible wellbeing. The Well-Being Index score for the nation comprises metrics affecting overall wellbeing and each of the five essential elements of wellbeing:
- Career wellbeing: You like what you do every day.
- Social wellbeing: You have meaningful friendships in your life.
- Financial wellbeing: You manage your money well.

\paragraph{The notation used to describe type systems varies from presentation to presentation, so giving a comprehensive overview is impossible.}
 However, most presentations share a large, common subset, so this answer will attempt to provide a foundation of enough of the basics to understand variations on the common theme.
Syntax and grammars
Type systems as applied to programming language are syntactic systems. That is, a type system is a set of rules that operate on the (abstract) syntax of a programming language. For this reason, comprehensive treatments of type systems begin by providing the grammar of all the syntactic constructs considered by the type system using BNF notation. In the simplest typed languages, syntax is needed for precisely two things: expressions and types.
For example, let’s consider the grammar for an extremely simple language of booleans and integers:
\$\$
begin\{array\}\{rcll\}
e hskip\{-10mu\}
\&::=\&hskip\{-10mu\} mathsf\{true\}hskip\{10mu\}|hskip\{10mu\}mathsf\{false\} \&textrm\{boolean literal\}
\& | \&hskip\{-10mu\} 0 hskip\{5mu\}|hskip\{5mu\} 1 hskip\{5mu\}|hskip\{5mu\} \{-1\} hskip\{5mu\}|hskip\{5mu\} 2 hskip\{5mu\}|hskip\{5mu\} \{-2\} hskip\{5mu\}|hskip\{5mu\} ldots \&textrm\{integer literal\}

TL;DR (summarised by ChatGPT) - I'm experiencing increased productivity and independence with ChatGPT but grappling with challenges such as lack of work-life boundaries and overwhelming information, leading to stress and burnout.
Long story...
I have been using ChatGPT for a while, and moved to the Plus subscription for their GPT-4 model, which I must say, is quite good.
1. ChatGPT makes us very productive. Personally, in my early 40s, I feel my brain is back in 20s.
2. I no longer feel the need to hire juniors. This is a short-term positive and maybe a long-term negative.
[[EDIT: I may have implied a wrong meaning. To clarify - nobody's going yet because of ChatGPT. It is just raising the bar high and higher. What took me years to learn, this thing can do already and much more. And I cannot predict the financial future of OpenAI or the markets in general.]]
A lot of stuff I used to delegate to fellow humans are now being delegated to ChatGPT. And I can get the results immediately and at any time I want. I agree that it cannot operate on its own. I still need to review and correct things. I have do that even when working with other humans. The only difference is that I can start trusting a human to improve, but I cannot expect ChatGPT to do so. Not that it is incapable, but because it is restricted by OpenAI.
And I have gotten better at using it. Calling myself a prompt-engineer sounds weird.
With all the good, I am now experiencing the cons, stress and burnout:

\textbf{Hello,
I am an experienced developer (11y) trying to earn some money on the side.
I am looking for some tips what could I do.}
\paragraph{}

The reason I said "easy" in the title is because I have a full time job, so I can't commit to multi-month projects full time.
I earned some good money on Topcoder before, but currently there are only a very few projects listed.
I am not a good speaker, so things like Youtube channel, or streaming is out of the picture, I am not comfortable uploading videos of myself.
I checked freelancer websites, but competition is crazy there (developing a full-fledged ecommerce web application for \$100, and such)
Are there any other good websites like Topcoder?
What do YOU do to earn money on the side?
Edit: For suggestions about the US: I am actually living in Canada. If you have any Canada specific, please suggest :)
Beekeeping can offer a relaxing, nature-oriented antidote to the stresses of coding, and moreover, there is a burgeoning market for smart apiary technology. Bee mortality rates have increased over recent years for numerous reasons, and technology is beginning to find ways to address these problems.
As a developer, you could design systems to monitor hive health, honey production levels or even bee activity. This data can be used to predict illnesses, optimize honey production, or understand more about bee behavior, providing valuable insights to the beekeeping community as well as researchers.

Features
Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools in the world of image generation and manipulation. While they offer significant benefits, these models are often considered black boxes due to their inherent complexity. The current diffusion image generation ecosystem is defined by tools that allow one-off image manipulation tasks to control these models - text2img, in-painting, pix2pix, among others.
For example, popular interfaces like Automatic1111, Midjourney, and Stability.AI's DreamStudio only support destructive editing: each edit "consumes" the previous image. This means users cannot easily build off of previous images or run multiple experiments on the same image, limiting their options for creative exploration.
Layering and Non-destructive Editing
Non-destructive editing is a method of image manipulation that preserves the original image data while allowing users to make adjustments and modifications without overwriting previous

\textbf{Ubicloud
Ubicloud is an open, free, and portable cloud. Think of it as an open alternative to cloud providers, like what Linux is to proprietary operating systems.}
\paragraph{}

Ubicloud provides IaaS cloud features on bare metal providers, such as Hetzner, OVH, and AWS Bare Metal. You can set it up yourself on these providers or you can use our managed service. We're currently in public alpha.
Quick start
Managed platform
You can use Ubicloud without installing anything. When you do this, we pass along the underlying provider's benefits to you, such as price or location.
Build your own cloud
You can also build your own cloud. To do this, start up Ubicloud's control plane and connect to its cloud console.
git clone git@github.com:ubicloud/ubicloud.git \# Generate secrets for demo ./demo/generate\_env \# Run containers: db-migrator, app (web \& respirate), postgresql docker-compose -f demo/docker-compose.yml up \# Visit localhost:3000
The control plane is responsible for cloudifying bare metal Linux machines. The easiest way to build your own cloud is to lease instances from one of those providers. For example: https://www.hetzner.com/sb
Once you lease instance(s), run the following script for each instance to cloudify the instance. By default, the script cloudifies bare metal instances leased from Hetzner. After you cloudify your instances, you can provision and manage cloud resources on these machines.
\# Enter hostname/IP and provider, and install SSH key as instructed by script docker exec -i

\textbf{Hi HN, we're Lucas and Lucas, the authors of Layerform (https://github.com/ergomake/layerform). Layerform is an open-source tool for setting up development environments using plain .tf files.}
\paragraph{}
 We allow each engineer to create their own "staging" environment and reuse infrastructure.
Whenever engineers run layerform spawn, we use plain .tf files to give them their own "staging" environment that looks just like production.
Many teams have a single (or too few) staging environments, which developers have to queue to use. This is particularly a problem when a system is large, because then engineers can't run it on their machines and cannot easily test their changes in a production-like environment. Often they end up with a cluttered Slack channel in which engineers wait for their turn to use staging. Sometimes, they don't even have that clunky channel and end up merging broken code or shipping bugs to production. Lucas and I decided to solve this because we previously suffered with shared staging environments.
Layerform gives each developer their own production-like environment.This eliminates the bottleneck, increasing the number of deploys engineers make. Additionally, it reduces the amount of bugs and rework because developers have a production-like environment to develop and test against. They can just run "layerform spawn" and get their own staging.
We wrap the MPL-licensed Terraform and allow engineers to encapsulate each part of their infrastructure into layers. They can th

Things you forgot (or never knew) because of React
Part 1: an intro about music, defaults, and bubbles
Like a lot of people, there was a time when the only music I listened to was whatever was played on my local radio station. (A lot of people over 30 or so, anyway. If this doesn’t sound familiar to you yet, just stick with me for a minute here.) At the time, I was happy with that. It seemed like all I needed.
Looking back, I realize: I naively trusted that anything good inevitably became popular—and therefore, anything worth knowing would eventually come my way on its own.
Eventually, though, other music began to take root in my life. Through new friends and the internet, I became acquainted with new artists, further and further from the things I liked before—or, at least, thought I liked.
This music was different. I wasn’t in love with it one week and sick of it the next. Listening to it wasn’t part of an endless cycle.
If anything, it was the opposite; it was music I actually liked and appreciated more the more I listened to it. There was depth to it. Sure, it didn’t have the loud distorted guitars, punch-line lyrics, or sugar-coated melodies I’d enjoyed up until that point. But to my surprise, that actually somehow made it better, not worse.
That’s when I began to realize: maybe I was never really as satisfied as I thought I was.
Maybe my bliss was, in fact, predicated on ignorance.
Finding richness beyond the defaults
I suspect you can probably relate to that story, even

LearnDB
What I Cannot Create, I Do Not Understand -Richard Feynman
In the spirit of Feynman's immortal words, the goal of this project is to better understand the internals of databases by implementing a relational database management system (RDBMS) (sqlite clone) from scratch.
This project was motivated by a desire to: 1) understand databases more deeply and 2) work on a fun project. These dual goals led to a:
- relatively simple code base
- relatively complete RDBMS implementation
- written in pure python
- No build step
- zero configuration
- configuration can be overriden
This makes the learndb codebase great for tinkering with. But the product has some key limitations that means it shouldn't be used as an actual storage solution.
Features
Learndb supports the following:
- it has a rich sql (learndb-sql) with support for
select, from, where, group by, having, limit, order by
- custom lexer and parser built using
lark
- at a high-level, there is an engine that can accept some SQL statements. These statements expresses operations on a database (a collection of tables which contain data)
- allows users/agents to connect to RDBMS in multiple ways:
- REPL
- importing python module
- passing a file of commands to the engine
- on-disk btree implementation as backing data structure
Limitations
- Very simplified 1 implementation of floating point number arithmetic, e.g. compared to IEEE754).
- No support for common utility features, like wildcard column expansion, e.g.
select * ..

\textbf{I’ve been leading a team developing an application using Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView for the last 18 months and accumulated some thoughts on the stack.}
\paragraph{}
 For the most part, it has been a very pleasant experience.
Compared to my initial evaluation of Elixir that I’d done prior to diving in in earnest, it exceeded my expectations in terms of availability of tools \& packages and the overall quality of dev experience.
Prior to Elixir, I was working primarily with Elm which probably colours my experience, but I have used a bunch of languages and have switched from static to dynamic types and back several times.
First of all, I find Elixir quite enjoyable:
As the pipeline example illustrates, Elixir seems to me to be one of those projects where instead of chasing the perfect design of every feature it’s OK to put in place pragmatic solutions even if they have warts. Some things are messy as a result but that’s an acceptable compromise:
Enum/
Map/
List/
Keywordand
Kernel, or things like
MapSetinstead of
Set, or charlists (needed for compatibility with Erlang), or inconsistent naming (
is\_mapvs
empty?).
unlessor the ability to define some custom operators, or all the different ways to access values in maps \& structs that seem to be a bit confusing to newcomers.
f.()) is weird for an FP language.
My experience with Phoenix has been almost entirely with a LiveView lens, so I don’t have that much to say about Phoenix itself. It seems to be a reasonable MVC framework. The very welcome add

\textbf{Railway Oriented Programming
This page contains links to the slides and code from my talk “Railway Oriented Programming”.}
\paragraph{}

Here’s the blurb for the talk:
Many examples in functional programming assume that you are always on the “happy path”. But to create a robust real world application you must deal with validation, logging, network and service errors, and other annoyances.
So, how do you handle all this in a clean functional way?
This talk will provide a brief introduction to this topic, using a fun and easy-to-understand railway analogy.
I am also planning to upload some posts on these topics soon. Meanwhile, please see the recipe for a functional app series, which covers similar ground.
If you want to to see some real code, I have created this project on Github that compares normal C\# with F\# using the ROP approach
WARNING: This is a useful approach to error handling, but please don’t take it to extremes! See my post on “Against Railway-Oriented Programming”.
I presented on this topic at NDC London 2014 (click image to view video)
Other videos of this talk are available are from NDC Oslo 2014 and Functional Programming eXchange, 2014

\textbf{Announcing turmoil
January 3, 2023
Today, we are happy to announce the initial release of
turmoil,
a framework for developing and testing distributed systems.
Testing distributed systems is hard.}
\paragraph{}
 Non-determinism is everywhere (network, time, threads, etc.), making reproducible results difficult to achieve. Development cycles are lengthy due to deployments. All these factors slow down development and make it difficult to ensure system correctness.
turmoil strives to solve these problems by simulating hosts, time and the
network. This allows for an entire distributed system to run within a single
process on a single thread, achieving deterministic execution. We also provide
fine grain control over the network, with support for dropping, holding and
delaying messages between hosts.
Getting Started
To use
turmoil, add the crate to your
Cargo.toml file:
[dev-dependencies] turmoil = "0.3"
Similar to
loom, we provide simulated networking types that mirror
tokio::net. Define a new module in your crate named
net or any other name of
your choosing. In this module, list out the types that need to be toggled
between
turmoil and
tokio::net:
pub use tokio::net::*; pub use turmoil::net::*;
Then, write your software using networking types from this local module.
mod simulation \{ fn simulate\_it() -> turmoil::Result \{ // build the simulation let mut sim = turmoil::Builder::new().build(); // setup a host sim.host("server", || async move \{ // host software goes here \}); // setup the test sim.cli

\paragraph{}
\textbf{I have been writing a lot more Go this past year. For those not familiar, Go favours a non-ORM, non-query-builder approach to interacting with databases.}
\paragraph{}
 This comes naturally due to the sql package: A common interface to be used alongside database drivers. It’s very common to see actual SQL in Go, even in large projects. On the other hand, Python does not have anything in the standard library that supports database interaction, this has always been a problem for the community to solve. There are many ORMs and query builders for Python:
- SQLAlchemy
- Django ORM
- Peewee (my personal favourite)
- … plenty more!
You can of course just take your favourite adapter and write SQL in Python (which is what we’ll be doing!), but I think most developers will agree that, as soon as you need to interact with a database, it is far more probable to immediately reach for an ORM like SQLAlchemy.
(This is not to say Go doesn’t have popular ORMs, but you’re much more likely to see Go devs leveraging the standard library and database adapters, this is the typical approach new Go devs will be directed to.)
In this post, I will aim to approach SQL in Python in the same vein as Go:
- I want to write SQL.
- I don’t want to rely on a query builder (let alone an ORM).
- I want to package all of this in an abstraction that allows me to quickly change between database solutions, as well as make it easy to test.
- l want a very clear separation between my database(s) and business logic.

\textbf{Lua, in the realm of Neovim, is a curious companion. For personal configuration tweaks, it’s incredibly responsive, giving me immediate feedback.}
\paragraph{}
 Moreover, when I’m uncertain about an idea’s potential, Lua offers a forgiving platform for prototyping without commitment.
Yet, as the maintainer of a few plugins, who otherwise works with Haskell professionally, I have mixed feelings. Its dynamic typing casts shadows of unpredictability, making Neovim plugins susceptible to unexpected bugs at the wrong time.
When it comes to Neovim plugin (and Lua) development, the right tools can be game-changers.
I’m aware of typed languages that compile to Lua, but here’s a native approach.
Here, I’ll delve into my experiences in leveraging
lua-language-server
and its support for type annotations,
demonstrating how they can elevate the robustness and expressiveness of your Lua code.
As an example, we will be attempting to define an algebraic data type (ADT),
and using
lua-language-server for static type checking.
What are algebraic data types (ADT)s?
For those steeped in the world of functional languages like Haskell, F\#, or OCaml, the term ADT might sound familiar. If that’s you, feel free to skip ahead.
But if ADTs sound Greek to you, a straightforward analogy would be Rust Enums, which are, in fact, ADTs. They’re powerful constructs allowing versatile and type-safe data modeling.
I want to keep this post short, so I will assume this is enough information for you to know all the niceties that

Cloud Data Warehouses (CDWs) are increasingly working their way into the dependency graph for important parts of the business: user-facing features, operational tools, customer comms, and even billing. Running this kind of operational work on a CDW might look promising initially but companies paint themselves into a corner as workloads expand: Either the cost (in warehouse invoices) to deliver the work outpaces the value delivered, or hard performance limits inherent to the design of analytical data warehouses prevent teams from delivering the capabilities necessary to serve the work in production.
Why? Operational workloads have fundamental requirements that are diametrically opposite from the requirements for analytical systems, and we’re finding that a tool designed for the latter doesn’t always solve for the former. That said, teams running operational work on the warehouse aren’t completely irrational. There are many good reasons for building this way, especially initially.
What is operational?
First, a working definition. An operational tool facilitates the day-to-day operation of your business. Think of it in contrast to analytical tools that facilitate historical analysis of your business to inform longer term resource allocation or strategy. If an operational system goes down for the day, there are people who will either be unable to do their job, or deliver a degraded service that day.

\textbf{CSS Selectors: A Visual Guide
✨ Here's a visual guide to the most popular CSS selectors.}
\paragraph{}

CSS selectors are patterns used in CSS to select and style HTML elements on a page, allowing us to dictate how styles apply to specific HTML elements.
Along with traditional CSS selectors, we also have pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. Pseudo-classes allow us to define styles based on an element's state or its relation to other elements. Think of things like hovering over a button or selecting the first item in a list. Pesudo-classes start with a colon character (:).
On the other hand, pseudo-elements give you the power to target and style specific parts of an element, such as its first line or before and after its content. Pseudo-elements start with two colons (::).
This guide serves as your map, detailing and visualizing these essential selectors.

\textbf{Why font-size must NEVER be in pixels
— 4 minutes to read
Certain font-related CSS properties will render your site completely inaccessible if their value is declared using pixels even once.}
\paragraph{}

Which properties are affected?
All of these properties must never ever be declared in pixels.
font-size
line-height
letter-spacing
Even if your style guide or design file gives you these sizes in pixels (or pts), we must translate those values into more appropriate units.
Why does it matter?
A lot more people than you may think change their base text size, usually making it larger. This can be done at an operating system level or at a browser level.
As browsers and devices make settings searchable and more user-friendly, the number of people tweaking font settings will only increase. (I once walked in on my mum holding a magnifying glass up to her computer screen because she didn't know she could change the text size! 🤭 Thankfully, those days are long behind her...)
If you've used pixels to define any of the above style properties, these will not respect the user's font size preferences!
At best this means text content becomes too small for some people to read comfortably (bring out that magnifying glass!). At worst, it means letters or lines will overlap each other, making the text totally unreadable! 😱
The good news is, if we DO use appropriate units, everything will scale beautifully for ALL users, no matter what changes they make in their settings. And these are easy changes to make!

\textbf{Adapting Illustrations to Dark Mode
3 min read
I want to share with you a quick way to make illustrations on your website work in both light and dark mode:
.dark .}
\paragraph{}
invert-on-dark \{ filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg); \}
Try it!
Toggle dark mode in the navigation bar and see the cover photo switch colors.
How it works
Intuitively, you want to swap black for white, white for black. For colors, you want to swap lighter colors for darker colors and vice versa.
invert(1)
Using
invert(1) from the CSS Filter Effects, you can invert the colors:
.dark .invert-on-dark \{ filter: invert(1); \}
After inversion, light parts of the image appear dark and vice versa.
Unfortunately, colors are reversed too: red becomes cyan, green becomes pink, blue becomes yellow, ... You don't want this!
To understand why, let's look at what the
invert(1) function does:
function invert(\{ r, g, b \}) \{ return \{ r: 255 - r, g: 255 - g, b: 255 - b \}; \}
The invert function operates in the RGB color space. First, the color is broken up into its Red, Green and Blue components. Then, each value is subtracted from the maximum possible value, 255.
We can do the math to see the color flipping in action:
invert(\{ r: 0, g: 0, b: 0 \}) // black -> \{ r: 255, g: 255, b: 255 \} // white invert(\{ r: 0, g: 255, b: 0 \}) // green -> \{ r: 255, g: 0, b: 255 \} // pink
For every color, its complimentary color is returned. When inverting for dark mode, we're aiming for a color palette that retains the original's intent. We need a differ

 Imagine people-pleasing to an absolute fault, and being more of a chameleon that adapts to avoid conflicts. This has led to problems of identity, and deriving my sense of worth through others which isn't healthy.
Fortunately, I do not have the same problems professionally and part of my people-pleasing skills have been put to good use there.
However, history continued and continues to repeat itself to this day. I'm more than half-way into this book and am not only seeing patterns from my childhood, my relationships with my parents, and my early relationships (platonic \& romantic)
It's been eye-opening, and I consider it my first step in breaking this trend.

Is that also what I can expect from the book, or did I come to conclusions too quickly?
The men's rights stuff tells them they've been sold a lie/raw deal by society, and that they can get power, success, etc. by rejecting that narrative that didn't work for them. Yes, this involves a lot of fear, misogyny, etc. but at it's core there is the message that it's your own fault, and you need to take responsibility: learn to set boundaries, work hard, prioritize and communicate your own needs, develop vulnerability and emotional intelligence, etc. Old self help books that really work are extremely popular in these communities, and these men sup

\paragraph{}
A Warning From the Unpublished Preface to Orwell’s Animal FarmOnly discovered in 1971, the Preface offers George Orwell’s critical but neglected insights into the nature of censorship in a free society
George Orwell‘s novella Animal Farm (1945) was a political fable. The cleverly portrayed animals who chase off the farmer and try to run the farm as a utopia slowly begin to replicate all the attitudes and practices against which they had rebelled. The story, summarized here, satirizes the Soviet Union’s transition from revolution to totalitarianism under Joseph Stalin (1878–1953). In fact, the animal characters and incidents are often allusions to historical Soviet figures and events.
His Preface, “The Freedom of the Press,” was omitted from the first edition of the book, then disappeared, and was not rediscovered until 1971. From it, we learn that Orwell had considerable difficulty getting his fable published. That wasn’t principally because of wartime issues. There was a shortage of books and his was highly readable. Rather, British intellectuals of the day did not wish to hear any criticism of Stalin or allusions to his atrocities:
Obviously it is not desirable that a government department should have any power of censorship (except security censorship, which no one objects to in war time) over books which are not officially sponsored. But the chief danger to freedom of thought and speech at this moment is not the direct interference of the MOI or any official body. If publ

\textbf{Is this a good book for me, now?
I used to believe that every book has an objective value. And I used to believe that this value is fixed and universal.}
\paragraph{}

Now, I believe it’s much more useful to say something in this form: this book has this value to this person in this context.
For example, Mindset by Carol Dweck was life changing to me when I read it in 2016.
The “me” part is important because I grew up thinking that intelligence is fixed and my skill in each activity I tried was based on talent and was fixed. So I thought I should to do the things I had a knack for, and I thought that the things I found difficult would stay difficult. Learning about a growth mindset was extremely valuable to me.
The 2016 part - the context - was also important. I’d just spent the last three years working at the Recurse Center, a place and community suffused with the idea that people can grow. I was primed for these ideas.
A second example. Around ten years ago I read You and your research by Richard Hamming. This is an essay by a mathematician who did ground-breaking research into telecommunications. He relates this anecdote:
I had been eating for some years with the Physics table at the Bell Telephone Laboratories restaurant…Fame, promotion and hiring by other companies ruined the average quality of the people so I shifted to the Chemistry table in another corner of the restaurant. I began by asking what the important problems were in chemistry, then later what important problems they were

\textbf{Peter Pan copyright
Who owns the copyright to Peter Pan?
J M Barrie gifted the rights to Peter Pan to Great Ormond Street Hospital in 1929.}
\paragraph{}
 Over the years, this generous gift has provided a significant source of income to help support the work of the hospital, and to help provide seriously ill children with the best chance to fulfil their potential.
Copyright Designs and Patents Act
The copyright first expired in the UK (and the rest of Europe) in 1987, 50 years after Barrie’s death.
However, former Prime Minister Lord Callaghan successfully proposed an amendment to the Copyright Designs and Patents Act (CDPA) of 1988, giving Great Ormond Street Hospital the unique right to royalties from stage performances of Peter Pan (and any adaptation of the play) as well as from publications, audio books, ebooks,radio broadcasts and films of the story of Peter Pan, in perpetuity.
Copyright in UK and Europe
In 1996, the copyright term was extended to 70 years after the author’s death throughout the European Union, which meant Peter Pan enjoyed revived copyright until 31 December 2007, after which it entered the public domain in Europe.
In the UK, the CDPA therefore prevails so that the hospital will continue enjoying the benefit of Barrie’s gift in perpetuity.
US copyright
Although the novel Peter Pan (also known as Peter and Wendy) is in the public domain in the US, the play (and stage adaptations) is in copyright there until December 2023.
This is because the novel was published in 191

Few developments since President Jimmy Carter signed the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 have so riled and divided the American trucking industry as the mandatory installation of electronic logging devices in most heavy-duty trucks. Praised and pushed by carriers and regulators but reviled by most truckers, ELDs were positioned as a mandated step toward improving highway safety by combating driver fatigue.
A new book by a Cornell University professor takes a deep dive into the arrival and use of ELDs, and the effect the technology has had on truckers. Data Driven: Truckers, Technology, and the New Workplace Surveillance by Karen Levy arrived last month from Princeton University Press.
We had a chance to speak with Levy, who is an associate professor of information science in Cornell's Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. (The following has been edited for clarity and brevity.)
Truckers News: Interesting book. Quite the topic within the industry. What prompted you to write this?
Karen Levy: It was kind of a little bit of an unexpected twist in my life. I started the book when I was a graduate student. I was studying sociology, getting my PhD, and before that I had gotten a law degree. So I was really interested in the law and kind of how it functions, and especially the relationship between law and technology. So I feel it's increasingly common to kind of see governments or companies or other groups turn to technology as a way to enforce rules more strictly or

80 of bosses say they regret earlier return-to-office plans: ‘A lot of executives have egg on their faces’
After three years of haphazard plans for getting workers back at their desks, the return-to-office movement has entered a phase of remorse.
A whopping 80 of bosses regret their initial return-to-office decisions and say they would have approached their plans differently if they had a better understanding of employees' office attendance, their usage of office amenities and other related factors, according to new research from Envoy.
"Many companies are realizing they could have been a lot more measured in their approach, rather than making big, bold, very controversial decisions based on executives' opinions rather than employee data," Larry Gadea, Envoy's CEO and founder, tells CNBC Make It.
Envoy interviewed more than 1,000 U.S. company executives and workplace managers who work in-person at least one day per week.
Some leaders lamented the challenge of measuring the success of in-office policies, while others said it's been hard to make long-term real estate investments without knowing how employees might feel about being in the office weeks, or even months, from now.
Kathy Kacher, a consultant who advises corporate executives on their return-to-office plans, is surprised the percentage isn't higher.
"Many organizations that attempted to force a return to the office have had to retract or change their plans because of employee pushback, and now, they don't look stron

\paragraph{}
🌈✨🥂
In this doc I mention Christine, my wonderful, brilliant cofounder and CEO, and the time (years ago) when our relationship had broken down completely, forcing us to rebuild our trust from the ground up.
(Cofounder relationships can be hard. They are a lot like marriages; in their difficulty and intensity, yes, but also in that when you’re doing it with the right person, it’s all worth it. 💜)
Tips for Careful Communication
When a relationship has very little trust, you tend to interpret everything someone says in the worst possible light, or you may hear hostility, contempt, or dismissiveness where none exists. On the other side of the exchange, the conversation becomes a minefield, where it feels like everything you say gets misinterpreted or turned against you no matter how careful you are trying to be. This can turn into a death spiral of trust where every interaction ends up with each of you hardening against each other a little more and filing away ever more wounds and slights. 💔
Yet you HAVE to communicate in order to work together! You have to be able to ask for things and give feedback.
The way trust gets rebuilt is by ✨small, positive interactions✨. If you’re in a trust hole, you can’t hear them clearly, and they can’t hear you (or your intent) clearly. So you have to

I love the monthly “Who is hiring?” thread — these positions almost always yield more responses and suffer less from false advertising.
Are there other sites I’m not considering? Methods I’m not using? How do you find good (defined as not bloated and optimized for LI) job opportunities in the current market?
My conclusion, so far, is unless you've got strong connections it's hard right now to find a job. Most job posting, as OP mentions get hundreds if not thousands of applications. Other times, I've personally also notice, candidates with perfect skill/experience matches get the same generic rejection ("we respect your experience but we're going to go with another candidate") or worse getting no response at all. There have been mentions of pseudo job posts (ie companies are just falsely advertising positions they are not actually look to fill). Ultimately, a really crappy situation for those looking for a job. Even experienced people, think 7,8,10+ years of experience, are seeing similar things unless they have a strong connection that get them to the final stage(s) of the internet process.
Happy to provide a links to relevant online discussions and articles about this situation if anyone is interested. Let me know.

\textbf{Breaking the rules: I threw away 10 months of work after 2 months on the job.
When I took over the team, they were in month 8 of a 3-month project to relaunch the company's ecommerce website.}
\paragraph{}
 After 2 months leading the team, I decided to scrap it and start over. This is the story of how and why, and whether it all worked out.
The relaunch of our ecommerce website had one goal: deliver blazing fast performance with Server-Side Rendering.
Our JavaScript bundle size was 168mb on a good day. The development environment took 3 minutes to become responsive on a top-of-the-line MacBook Pro. Engineers would regularly come in to work, type
npm run dev and go for a coffee while their machine's fans tried and failed to keep up with the demands placed on them by our bloated project.
Where did it go so wrong?
The backstory
The company's first website was an AngularJS single-page application. AngularJS didn't support server-side rendering, so the website was slow to render on first load, but snappy once everything had downloaded.
On the web, milliseconds matter - and this goes double for ecommerce. We needed to reduce our time to first meaningful paint.
Angular 2 was on the team's radar, and although it was a substantial departure from AngularJS, it seemed like the logical foundation for the new website. There was even an experimental server-side rendering feature branch under active development! Surely it would be ready to go by the time they were ready to ship!
The team built the site, r

)
This fascinated me. I think languages are really interesting but I'm also really bad at them. I cannot hack the memorization. I've mostly avoided conlangs (that's Constructed Languages, like Esperanto or Klingon) because like, oh no, now there's even more languages for me to fail at memorizing. So like, a language so minimal you can almost learn it by accident, suddenly my ears perk up.
Toki pona is really interesting, on a lot of different axes. It's a thought experiment in Taoist philosophy that turns out to be actually, practically useful. It's Esperanto But It Might Actually Work This Time¹. It has NLP implications— it's a human language which feels natural to speak yet has such a deeply logical structure it seems nearly custom-designed for simple computer programs to read and write it². Beyond all this it's simply beautiful as an intellectual object— nearly every decision it makes feels deeply right. It solves a seemingly insoluble problem³ and does it with a sense of effortlessness and an implied "LOL" at every step.
So what toki pona is. Toki pona is a language designed around the idea of being as simple as it is possible for a language to be. It has 120 words in its original form (now, at the twenty year mark, up to 123), but you can form a lot of interesting sentences with

Title:Thermodynamic Linear AlgebraDownload PDF
Abstract: Linear algebraic primitives are at the core of many modern algorithms in engineering, science, and machine learning. Hence, accelerating these primitives with novel computing hardware would have tremendous economic impact. Quantum computing has been proposed for this purpose, although the resource requirements are far beyond current technological capabilities, so this approach remains long-term in timescale. Here we consider an alternative physics-based computing paradigm based on classical thermodynamics, to provide a near-term approach to accelerating linear algebra.
At first sight, thermodynamics and linear algebra seem to be unrelated fields. In this work, we connect solving linear algebra problems to sampling from the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of a system of coupled harmonic oscillators. We present simple thermodynamic algorithms for (1) solving linear systems of equations, (2) computing matrix inverses, (3) computing matrix determinants, and (4) solving Lyapunov equations. Under reasonable assumptions, we rigorously establish asymptotic speedups for our algorithms, relative to digital methods, that scale linearly in matrix dimension. Our algorithms exploit thermodynamic principles like ergodicity, entropy, and equilibration, highlighting the deep connection between these two seemingly distinct fields, and opening up algebraic applicat

|Born||November 4, 1952|
|Died||April 20, 2007(aged 54)|
|Known for||Fish Disks|
Fred Fish (November 4, 1952 – April 20, 2007) was a computer programmer notable for work on the GNU Debugger and his series of freeware disks for the Amiga.
The Amiga Library Disks – colloquially referred to as Fish Disks (a term coined by Perry Kivolowitz at a Jersey Amiga User Group meeting) – became the first national rallying point, a sort of early postal system. Fish would distribute his disks around the world in time for regional and local user group meetings, which in turn duplicated them for local distribution. Typically, only the cost of materials changed hands. The Fish Disk series ran from 1986 to 1994. In it, one can chart the growing sophistication of Amiga software and see the emergence of many software trends.
The Fish Disks were distributed at computer stores and Amiga enthusiast clubs. Contributors submitted applications and source code and the best of these each month were assembled and released as a diskette. Since the Internet was not yet in popular usage outside military and university circles, this was a primary way for enthusiasts to share work and ideas.[1] He also initiated the "GeekGadgets" project, a GNU standard environment for AmigaOS and BeOS.
Fish worked for Cygnus Solutions in the 1990s before he left for Be Inc. in 1998.[2]

\textbf{Sargablock
Sargablock is a construction material made from sargassum seaweed, brown algae that washes up on Caribbean beaches and costs a fortune to the tourism industry.}
\paragraph{}
 Interest has spread from Mexico to countries around the Caribbean and beyond.
My journey began in 2015 when sargassum seaweed first started washing up on the shores of the Riviera Maya. Where others saw a problem, I saw an opportunity to turn it into its own sustainable solution, including placing it in service of people who need it the most.
I started collecting sargassum seaweed to use as fertilizer for my business, Blue-Green Nursery, and selling it in small amounts to my clients. Soon I obtained permits and within a year was employing about 300 families to clean the beaches for local hotels and resorts. But then it occurred to me that we could turn sargassum seaweed into construction bricks as it was already being used to make products like plates and other things. Inspired by the memory of my family’s little adobe house, I developed Sargablock, an architectural brick made from the sargassum seaweed that spoils our beaches between April and October.
I adjusted a machine designed to make adobe bricks so that it can process a mix of 40 sargassum and 60 other organic materials for the Sargablock. The machine can turn out 1,000 blocks a day, and after four hours of baking in the sun, they are dried and ready to be used. After we built Casa Angelita, the first sargassum house named after my mother, Sargablo

Ancient Fires Drove Large Mammals Extinct, Study Suggests
Fossils from La Brea Tar Pits in Southern California suggest that sabertooth cats and other large North American mammals disappeared as a result of wildfires spurred by human activity.
Wildfires are getting worse. Parts of the United States, scientists say, are experiencing wildfires three times as often — and four times as big — as they were 20 years ago. This summer alone, smoke from Canadian blazes turned North American skies an unearthly orange, “fire whirls” were seen in the Mojave Desert and raging flames in Maui led to disaster.
Records of the distant past can reveal what once drove increased fire activity and what can happen as a result. In a new study published Thursday in the journal Science, a group of paleontologists that analyzed fossil records at La Brea Tar Pits, a famous excavation site in Southern California, concluded that the disappearance of sabertooth cats, dire wolves and other large mammals in this region nearly 13,000 years ago was linked to rising temperatures and increased fire activity spurred by people.
“We implicate humans as being the primary cause of the tipping point,” said Robin O’Keefe, an evolutionary biologist at Marshall University. “What happened in La Brea, is it happening now? Well, that’s a really good question — and I think we should figure it out.”
Earth has seen five mass extinction events so far; some scientists argue that the disappearance of large mammals at t

\textbf{This is a fun little problem that's remarkably close and the math is pretty easy when you use the right periods.
Venus' synodic period, relative to Earth, is 583.92 days on average.}
\paragraph{}
 He uses 584, but lets strive for accuracy. Venus' solar day is 116.75 days, so 5 solar days is 583.75 days - Venus does 5 rotations in nearly the same amount of time that Earth and Venus line up together.
More details below:
Eccentricity in this case, doesn't matter, so, even though Earth will move different amounts in those 218 days past the first full year, it's the average that matters.
A cool property of tidal locking is that the locked objects can move ahead or behind and it doesn't undo the locking. For example, our Moon is tidally locked but its eccentricity still creates libration. Pluto can move ahead of or fall behind its 3/2 resonance with Neptune, but Neptune's gravity draws it back, so it never laps the 3/2 resonance. It stays locked. All we need is the average synodic period, or 583.92 days.
.03 is closer than many tidally locked objects' periods can be, but that doesn't mean they're tidally locked. One can still lap the other.
We know it's coincidence because orbital periods, which determine the 583.92 ratio, are highly stable and Venus' orbital period might change very slowly, but only very slowly.
The variation is a little under .03 or 3 parts in 10,000. It's close enough that we might want to get more decimal points to get more accuracy, but that's where I run into some problem

Core War is a 1984 programming game created by D. G. Jones and A. K.}
\paragraph{}
 Dewdney in which two or more battle programs (called "warriors") compete for control of a virtual computer. These battle programs are written in an abstract assembly language called Redcode. The standards for the language and the virtual machine were initially set by the International Core Wars Society (ICWS), but later standards were determined by community consensus.
Gameplay[edit]
At the beginning of a game, each battle program is loaded into memory at a random location, after which each program executes one instruction in turn. The goal of the game is to cause the processes of opposing programs to terminate (which happens if they execute an invalid instruction), leaving the victorious program in sole possession of the machine.
The earliest published version of Redcode defined only eight instructions. The ICWS-86 standard increased the number to 10 while the ICWS-88 standard increased it to 11. The currently used 1994 draft standard has 16 instructions. However, Redcode supports a number of different addressing modes and (starting from the 1994 draft standard) instruction modifiers which increase the actual number of operations possible to 7168. The Redcode standard leaves the underlying instruction representation undefined and provides no means for programs to access it. Arithmetic operation

The move comes after recent criticism on social media from customers who are concerned about the privacy implications of Zoom using data in such a manner.
Backing Down on Data Use Plans
"Following feedback, Zoom made the decision to update its Terms of Service to reflect Zoom does not use any of your audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments or other communications-like Customer Content (such as poll results, whiteboard and reactions) to train Zoom or third-party artificial intelligence models," a spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. "Zoom has accordingly updated its Terms of Service and product to make this policy clear."
Zoom's decision — and the reason for it — is sure to add to the growing debate about the privacy and security implications of technology companies using customer data to train AI models.
In Zoom's case, the company recently introduced two generative AI features — Zoom IQ Meeting Summary and Zoom IQ Team Chat Compose — that offer AI-powered chat composition and automated meeting summaries.

China's heavily indebted property giant Evergrande Group on Thursday filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in a U.S. court.
In a filing with the Manhattan bankruptcy court, the company referenced restructuring proceedings in Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands.
In a separate statement, Evergrande on Friday said that it will ask the U.S. court for "recognition of the schemes of arrangement under the offshore debt restructuring for Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands."
It added, "The application is a normal procedure for the offshore debt restructuring and does not involve bankruptcy petition."

LUXEMBOURG
SUSE®, the company behind SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE), Rancher and NeuVector and a global leader in enterprise open source solutions, is announcing that its majority shareholder Marcel LUX III SARL (Marcel) intends to take the company private by delisting it from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange via a merger into an unlisted Luxembourg entity in the legal form of an S.A.
Marcel, a holding company that is legally controlled by fund entities of the EQT VIII fund (referred to herein, together with Marcel, as EQT Private Equity), which in turn are managed and legally controlled by affiliates of EQT AB with its registered seat in Stockholm, Sweden, holds approximately 79 of the shares in SUSE.
EQT Private Equity has announced its intention to launch a voluntary public purchase offer to the other shareholders of SUSE (Offer) to buy their shares prior to the delisting. The offer price per SUSE share to be paid by Marcel will be EUR 16.00 less the gross amount per SUSE share of an interim dividend to be paid by SUSE to all shareholders. EUR 16.00 represents a premium of approximately 67 percent on the XETRA closing share price of EUR 9.605 on 17 August 2023.
SUSE’s Management Board and Supervisory Board support the strategic opportunity from delisting of the company as it will allow SUSE to focus fully on its operational priorities and execution of its long-term strategy. To this end SUSE has entered into a Transaction Framework Agreement (TFA) with Marcel to facilitate the t

Join our community Discord: AI Stack Devs
AI Town is a virtual town where AI characters live, chat and socialize.}
\paragraph{}

This project is a deployable starter kit for easily building and customizing your own version of AI town. Inspired by the research paper Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior.
The primary goal of this project, beyond just being a lot of fun to work on, is to provide a platform with a strong foundation that is meant to be extended. The back-end engine natively supports shared global state, transactions, and a journal of all events so should be suitable for everything from a simple project to play around with to a scalable, multi-player game. A secondary goal is to make a JS/TS framework available as most simulators in this space (including the original paper above) are written in Python.
