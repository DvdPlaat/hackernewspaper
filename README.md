# hackernewspaper

The hacker**news**letter, but as a PDF paper. For offline, for faster recall, faster reading.   
A Latex based pdf containing the hackernewsletter edition including the categories, screenshots, metadata, some 'gatherd' texts.. 

 
## Motivation

I :heart: the hacker**news**letter. But I also cannot remember the links I've already opened, viewed, readed, watched. Only the name of the link in the email are not enough (for me..) to memorize what i've seen and not. But I do, as soon as the page opens in the browser, at that moment, i can exactly recall most of it. I just wanted to have a quicker overview of the newsletter. 

Therefor I started with the links being presented as a simple screen capture of the webpage, so I would be faster to recall what each link referred to. But ended up with much more....

## Screenshots
I used `playwright` to generate screenshots of the links.
Or `pythumb` in case of a YouTube link. 

## Credits
Praise and credits for [Kale Davis](www.kaledavis.com), as he is doing all the hard work of handpicking/organizing the articles each week.

## Help wanted
I'm not a Latex expert and the layout, especially the things with the two columns, are quite difficult to get the vertical alignment, page breaks, etc. the way it should be...

## TODO / NICE-TO-HAVES
[ ] Solve the GDPR Cookie problems on some screenshot. Auto accept?
[ ] Better text formatting. Something with a LLM ?
[ ] Sometimes the metadata hints at a second image. Use that image as well?
