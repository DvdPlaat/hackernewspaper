The HackerNewsLetter in Newspaper format.  
An Latex generated PDF containing the HackerNewsLetter edition.

## Motivation

I LOVE :heart: the HackerNewsLetter , but i cannot remember the links i already opened, viewed, watched.
The name of the links alone are not enough (for me..) to memorize what i've seen and not. 
But i noticed that, as soon as the page opens in the browser, i can recall most of it.

Therefor I wanted the links to be presented as an image, a screen capture, so I would be faster to recall what each link referred to.


## Screenshots
I used `playwright` to generate screenshots of the links.
Or `pythumb` in case of a YouTube link.
