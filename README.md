The hacker**news**letter as a paper.  
A Latex based pdf containing the HackerNewsLetter edition including the categories, screenshots, 


## Motivation

I :heart: the hacker**news**letter  , but i cannot remember the links i already opened, viewed, watched.
The name of the links alone are not enough (for me..) to memorize what i've seen and not. But i noticed that, as soon as the page opens in the browser, i can recall most of it. I wanted to have a quicker 

Therefor I started with the links being presented as a simple screen capture of the webpage, so I would be faster to recall what each link referred to. But ended up with much more.... 


## Screenshots
I used `playwright` to generate screenshots of the links.
Or `pythumb` in case of a YouTube link.

## Credits
Praise and credits for [Kale Davis](www.kaledavis.com), as he is doing all the hard work of handpicking/organizing the articles each week.
